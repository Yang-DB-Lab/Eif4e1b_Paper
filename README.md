# Scripts related to NGS data analysis and OCT4 IF processing
Scripts related to scNMT-seq read alignment:

* seRNA-Seq: stores scripts related to single embryo RNA-Seq data analysis(Smart-seq part of seNMT-seq). Also used for RIP-seq and Ribo-seq (with minor modifications).
* scNMT_DNAseq_Part: scripts to align reads of seNMT-seq DNA-seq part. Hisat-3n is used for alignment.

Script for OCT4 IF cleaning:

* OCT4_IF_Clean: A short MATLAB script to remove non-specific OCT4 signals from early embryo IF.

Helper fold stores some scripts to help with real analysis.
